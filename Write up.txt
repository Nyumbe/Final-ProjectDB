
My project is a school student profile database consisting of four tables. The first is the students table that stores student information including Student name, age, sex, contact and nationality with id as the primary key. Another table is called faculty and it stores the academic program each student is enrolled in and the number of years spent doing the program with RegNo as the primary key.
The third table is the finance table and it stores tuition to be paid by every enrolled student in the various academic programs both for national and international students with AccNo as the primary key. The fourth table is a joint table to compare the ids of the different students in the student table with their attributes on the other finance and faculty tables to avoid repetitions and redundancy.
